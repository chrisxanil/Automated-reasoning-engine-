    Process a file containing multiple questions.
    
    Each question block is structured as follows:
    
      Q 1
      
      <Inference statement lines>
      
      Prove that:
      <Query statement line>

      - Extracts the question identifier (e.g., "Q 1", "Q 2", …)
      - Registers all inference statements into a new Knowledge Base for that question
      - Executes the query (the first line after "Prove that:")
      - Prints the question ID, extracted predicates, query, and results.

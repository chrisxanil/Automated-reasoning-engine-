# Automated Reasoning Engine

An advanced Python-based engine designed to perform automated reasoning on first-order logic statements. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze, parse, and evaluate logical statements, providing a robust foundation for applications in AI-driven reasoning and decision-making.

## Features

- **Tokenization & Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Efficiently identifies and classifies parts of speech (e.g., nouns, verbs, prepositions) using Python's NLTK library.
- **Proper Noun Classification**: Distinguishes proper nouns from common nouns using a comprehensive dataset.
- **Atomic Sentence Detection**: Parses and identifies atomic sentences to construct logical predicates.
- **Predicate Formation**: Translates natural language into predicate forms, similar to Prolog statements.
- **Text Parsing**: Analyzes large text files to extract relevant logical constructs.
- **Customizable Logic Rules**: Allows users to define and extend reasoning rules to fit specific needs.
- **Modular Design**: Highly modular codebase for ease of understanding, debugging, and extension.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-reasoning-engine.git
   cd automated-reasoning-engine
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. Prepare your input text or logical statements.
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py --input "path/to/your/input.txt"
   ```
3. View the parsed predicates, reasoning results, and any inferred conclusions.

### Example Input

```
All humans are mortal.
Socrates is a human.
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
```

### Example Output

```
Predicates:
- human(Socrates)
- mortal(Socrates)

Reasoning Result:
- True: Socrates is mortal.
```
